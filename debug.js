// very quick note to make debugging esier:

// can set break point inside web console and at that point, the values of varaibles will be displayed

// there is a continue to move to next breakpont


let total = 1;
 for (let i = 3; i > 0; i--) {
 	total *= 2; // if break was here, will continue to next loop point
 }
